# Uppercase-English-lable-count
This project is for my personal use. I referred to many other experts' codes to meet my personal requirement-- to count the frequency of upper case labels in my labeled texts. Because I am a beginner of python, systematically learning it just around 3 months, so there might be a lot of problems there in my codes. All advice will be welcome.
