# Uppercase-English-lable-count
This project is for personal use. I just refer to many other expert's code to meet my personal requirement- to count my upper case label frequency in my  labeled text. Because I am a beginner of python, systematically learning it just around 3 months, so there might be a lot of problems there in my codes. All advice will be welcome.
